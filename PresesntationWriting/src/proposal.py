## 🧩 Buyer Organization:

## 🏢 Seller Organization:
{description_s}

## 📋 Client Requirements (Project Needs, Expectations, Goals, Constraints):
{client_requirements}

## 🎯 Target Department:
{service_dept}

---

### 📄 Required Sections

Use the following sections in this exact order. Do **not create new sections**, and **do not rename them**. Keep most sections **concise (2–4 paragraphs)** but make **“Scope of Work” very detailed** with structured breakdowns.

{section_list}

At the end, always include:
- **Who We Are**
- **What We Do**

---

### 🛠️ Special Instructions for “Scope of Work”

This section must be written in **detailed breakdown format**.

- Use clear subheaders or bullet points for each phase or deliverable.
- Elaborate tasks clearly using context from additional informtation
-----------
{additional_info}.
----------------
IMPORTANT : If there is no breakdown of the task then breakdown yourself and then explain each phase with atleast 4-5 bullet points
and if there is breakdown then do try to utilize info and still write 4-5 points properly
- Example format:

Discovery & Planning (Week 1–2)

Conduct kickoff with buyer team to gather expectations

Create user journeys and goal mapping

Perform competitive audit for design inspiration and SEO alignment

UI/UX Design (Week 3–4)

Wireframes for key pages

Brand-aligned visual mockups with review cycles

Frontend Development (Week 5–7)

Responsive development using Bootstrap

Animations, product pages, and forms



Use **phase-wise structuring** like Discovery, Design, Development, Launch, SEO, etc., and explain each step in business-impact terms — showing **how it contributes to client goals**.

---

### ✍️ Writing Style & Examples

Follow these guidelines:

- ✅ Use a **professional, business-friendly tone** suitable for executive audiences.
- ✅ Write **2–4 paragraphs per section** — detailed, but not bloated.
- ✅ Use bullet points where appropriate (for Deliverables, Timelines, Fee Structure).
- ✅ Integrate `{client_requirements}` contextually — refer to business goals, constraints, project scope, and domain.
- ✅ Emphasize **value, clarity, and confidence** — this is a persuasive sales proposal.

---

### 📤 Output Format

Return the final result as a list of dictionaries, each with `"title"` and `"text"` fields, in **valid JSON-like format**:

```json
[ {{"title":"Title of the proposal","text":"..."}}
  {{"title": "Executive Summary", "text": "..."}},
  {{"title": "Scope of Work", "text": "..."}},
  ...
  {{"title": "Who We Are", "text": "..."}},
  {{"title": "What We Do", "text": "..."}}
]
